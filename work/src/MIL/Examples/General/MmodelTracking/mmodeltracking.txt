[SYNOPSIS]
This program shows how to track a unique object using pattern recognition. It allocates a model in the field of view of the camera and finds it in a loop. It also prints the coordinates of the found model and draws a box around it. It searches using 2 methods, the normalized grayscale correlation (Mpat), which is very fast and with the Geometric Model Finder (Mmod), which is independent of the model rotation and scale but slower.

Note:  Display update and annotations drawing can require significant CPU usage.
