[SYNOPSIS]
This program performs a double-buffering grab, times the processing, and displays some statistics.

Note:  The double-buffering method is not recommended for real-time processing when the CPU usage is high. For more robust real-time behavior, use the MdigProcess() function. See MDigProcess.c for a complete example.
