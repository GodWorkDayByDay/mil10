[SYNOPSIS]
This program shows the use of the MdigProcess() function to perform real-time processing. 
The user's processing code is written in a hook function that will be called for each frame grabbed (see ProcessingFunction()).
                                                                       
Note: The average processing time must be shorter than the grab time or some frames will be missed. 
Also, if the processing results are not displayed and the frame count is not drawn or printed, the CPU usage is reduced significantly.
