[SYNOPSIS]
This program contains 3 examples of the pattern matching module:
The first example defines a model and then searches for it in a shifted version of the image (without rotation).
The second example defines a model and then searches for it in a rotated version of the image.
The third example automatically allocates a model in a wafer image and finds its horizontal and vertical displacement.
