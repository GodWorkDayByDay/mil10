[SYNOPSIS]
This program uses the Geometric Model Finder module to define geometric models and searches for these models in a target image. A simple single model example (1 model, 1 occurrence, good search conditions) is presented first, followed by a more complex example (multiple models, multiple occurrences in a complex scene with bad search conditions).
