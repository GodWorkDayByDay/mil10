 * File name: DMilMdigProcessSharedMemory.cpp
 *
 * Synopsis:  This program shows the use of Distributed MIL (DMIL) and the MdigProcess() 
 *            function to do image capture using a 32 bit MIL process running on a 64 bit 
 *            OS.
 *
 *            The 32 bit process uses DMIL to send commands to a 64 bit MIL 
 *            and its device drivers. Images are acquired by the 64 bit DMIL Slave
 *            System and the grabbed images are copied very quickly to the 32 bit 
 *            MIL process via inter-process shared memory. 
 *
 *            32 bit MIL and 64 bit MIL with the DMIL option must be installed on 
 *            the same PC that will run the project. The project must be compiled
 *            in both Win32 and x64 platform so that all the necessary components 
 *            are generated and the DMIL DLL is copied to the proper directory on 
 *            the local PC.
